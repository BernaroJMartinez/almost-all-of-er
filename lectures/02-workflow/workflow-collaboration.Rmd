Agenda
===

- Organization 
- Reproducibility
- Version Control 

Organization
===

\center

One asset of being an efficient data scientist is being organized. 


Organization
===

Why is organization an important skill? 


Organization
===

Messy files and poorly documented code mean that:

- you will need to often dig through your code
- you will have trouble communicating with your collaborative team
- you will have a difficult workflow for a industry/academic project
- you will likely have trouble reproducing your results

These can all be disasterous if you're working on product development for a large company and they are depending on your skills, expertise, and analysis! 

Self-Assessment
===

Think about a recent programming assignment from the past year. 

- Do you think you can reproduce the results exactly? 

- Do you think that anyone in the class could easily understand your code (i.e., is it well documented)? 

Give a **short assessment** regarding one strength of your coding and one weakness that you plan to work on in this course. 


Collaborative Programming
===

How can we work collaboratively on a project involving code?

1. Create a strong team with a team leader to keep the group **organized** and **on track** 
2. Making sure that our code is **reproducible** and using software such as R markdown as one such option
3. Using **version control** (github) for our collaborative work in order to **effectively communicate** and **work together** 

Reproducibility
===

What is reproducibility and why is this important? 



The Reproducibility Crisis 
===

"The terms “reproducibility crisis” and “replication crisis” gained currency in conversation and in print over the last decade (Pashler & Wagenmakers 2012), as disappointing results emerged from large scale reproducibility projects in various medical, life and behavioural sciences (Open Science Collaboration, OSC 2015)."

The Reproducibility Crisis 
===

What does this mean? 

- Researchers are findings that we they try and replicate papers, they are not finding the same results as in the published work. 

- This has led to the above crisis, and thus, pushing us as data scientists to publish work that is fully transparent and can be checked when we pass it to someone else. 

Reproducibility
===

- Work is considered reproducible if the entire process can be replicated from start to finish. 

- This includes the data, code, figures --- everything. 

Reproducibility
===

- Why is reproducibility important for our community? 

- Why is reproducibility hard to achieve? 

Reproducibility
===


We just talked about **why** it's important for our work to be both organized and reproducible.

Let's talk about one tool we can use to make our work reproducible. 

Rmarkdown
===


- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

Put simply:

- R is like a car’s engine
- RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

R packages
===

To make our work the most reproducible as possible, best practice is writing our finished product into an R package available on CRAN and making this accessible to the community. 

R packages
===

1. CRAN packages have strict criteria for acceptance so this force you to write your code in best practice
2. You can tie in your R packages to your paper/project to make it reproducible from start to finish 

This is the most idealized way of writing software and working with a team. 

To learn more about R packages, you can check out \url{https://r-pkgs.org/}. 


Rmarkdown
===

[DEMO]

Let's perform a demo regarding how we can make a simple .Rmd file reproducible in markdown. 

Question: What are the benefits over just writing an R script? 

Version Control
===

What is version control?


Version Control
===

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

Version control systems (github) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.


Version Control 
===

- GitHub is a platform for collaboration
- It's really designed for version control 


Version Control 
===

Github and Tips
===

- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word.

- GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).

- There are a lot of Git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

Git and Github Tour
===

[DEMO]

- Connect an R project to GitHub repository
- Working with a local and remote repository
- Making a change locally, committing, and pushing
- Making a change on GitHub and pulling





Recap

Can you answer these questions?










<!-- Teams -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- Collaborative work is essential, and it's important to identify each role of each member of the group.  -->

<!-- I like to work in groups of two's or three's as otherwise the teams becomes crowded.  -->

<!-- Team Leader -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- - Your in charge of your team and your role is to lead -->
<!-- - Your role is to get feedback from your team regarding what is working well and what needs changes -->
<!-- - Your role is also to understanding how to place your team members in effective roles -->
<!-- - Your role is to chat with your supervisor (me) when you have questions to get guidance or have team meetings with me when you need group guidance  -->
<!-- - Your role is to also contribute to the team  -->
<!-- - If you find yourself not liking leading a group, it's important to state this (to me) so that there can be a role switch regarding team leadership.  -->

<!-- Support Team -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- Each Team has two support members, where you goal is to provide support and feedback to your team leader.  -->

<!-- - Your roles should be defined precisely, based upon your interests  -->
<!-- - Your main role might be to write up the backbone of the programming for a project, while another member checks and de-bugs your code.  -->

<!-- Example -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- Suppose we have team members Brian, Olivier, and Ale.  -->

<!-- Olivier is the team leader, and he responsibilities are as follows: -->

<!-- - He will set up his group's github repo and share it with the other members.  -->
<!-- - He will set up bi-weekly meetings with his group to work on projects so there is structured time for homeworks and projects.  -->
<!-- - He will ask each member their strengths and weakness so he can help identify what will work best for their team as a whole. -->
<!-- - He will have a team meeting to talk about identifying how to divide up tasks for the first homework project and setting deadlines.  -->

<!-- As an example, Brian has volunteered to code up the first homework assignment. Ale has volunteered to run Brian's code on the data set so he can de-bug and test it and write a draft of the homework assignment. Olivier has volunteered to do a full check of everything. The group will meet if there are any issues along the way.  -->
