## What is Bayesian Statistics?

*"Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials. &lt;/font&gt;."*

There is a schedule, where each TA is responsible for answering emails/questions on the Google group. To avoid repeated questions, we would ask that these be posted on the Google group. If you don't feel comfortable posting a question, send an email to a TA, and they will post your question for you. 

1. Monday: Lavonne (Backup: Ashley)
2. Tuesday: Michael (Backup: Olivier)
3. Wednesday: Olivier (Backup: Michael)
4. Thursday: Michael (Backup: Olivier)
5. Friday: Lavonne (Backup: Ashley)
6. Saturday: Ashley (Backup: Lavonne)
7. Sunday: Ashley (Backup: Lavonne)

Remark: Please keep in mind that TAs are taking classes as well and will not be responding to questions in real time, so please post questions early.

## Traditional inference

You are given **data** `\(X\)` and there is an **unknown parameter** you wish to estimate **$\theta$**

How would you estimate `\(\theta\)`?

---

## Traditional inference

You are given **data** `\(X\)` and there is an **unknown parameter** you wish to estimate `\(\theta\)`

How would you estimate `\(\theta\)`?

- In a very simple way, you could assume the data is normally distributed, and estimate the parameter by calculating the maximum likelihood estimator. 

- You could alternatively calculate an unbiased estimator. 

- In short, using methods from previously classes, there are many probabilistic methods that you could use. 

---

## Bayesian methods

When using a Bayesian method, we assume that we have access to information about the parameter of interest `\(\theta.\)`

In this sense, the parameter `\(\theta\)` is still unknown however we will treat it as a random variable and put a distribution on `\(\theta.\)`

Bayesian inference
===
Bayesian methods trace its origin to the 18th century and English Reverend Thomas Bayes, who along with Pierre-Simon Laplace discovered what we now call **Bayes' Theorem**

- `\(p(x \mid \theta)\;\;\; \text{likelihood}\)`  
- `\(p(\theta)\;\;\; \text{prior}\)` 
- `\(p(\theta \mid x)\;\;\; \text{posterior}\)` 
- `\(p(x)\;\;\; \text{marginal distribution}\)` 

`$$p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(\theta,x)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x)} \propto p(x|\theta)p(\theta)$$`

This course
===

This course starts with Bayes' Theorem and the basics of Bayesian statistics. 

We will then move to many common topics that are used in Bayesian statistics, surveying most of the methods covered in the text by Peter Hoff.

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Exam 1 | 20% |
| Exam 2 | 20% |
| Final Project | 30% |

--

- If you have a cumulative numerical average of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam.

- You are expected to attend lectures and labs in order to keep up with the course material. There will be no attendance grade or participation grade. 


&lt;/small&gt;

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean’s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp;amp; Regrade Requests

- No late homeworks will be accepted, so please do not ask.  
    
- No make up exams will be given.  

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment was returned (and must be done in writing). 

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

&gt; To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
&gt; - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
&gt; - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
&gt; - I will act if the Standard is compromised.
Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- **Google group**: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Google since there are likely other students with the same questions.

---

## Academic Resource Center

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Technology 

- You should bring a laptop to every lecture and lab session.  Outlets are limited, so make sure it is fully-charged.

- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.

- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.
