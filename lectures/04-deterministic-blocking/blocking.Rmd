Blocking
===

- Blocking partitions similar records into partitions/blocks.

- ER is only performed within each blocks. 

Traditional Blocking
===

- A deterministic (fixed) partition is formed based upon the data. 
- A partition is created by treating certain fields that are thought to be nearly error-free as fixed.
- Benefits:  simple, easy to understand, and fast to implement. 
- Downsides: the blocks are treated as error free, which is not usually accurate and can lead to errors in the ER task that cannot be accounted for. 

Example: Blocking on date of birth year. 

Probabilistic Blocking 
===

- A probability model is used to cluster the data into blocks/partitions. 

Example: Fellegi-Sunter (1969), or Locality Sensitive Hashing  

Under both blocking approaches, record pairs that do not meet the blocking criteria are automatically classified as non-matches.

# Example: RLdata500

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RecordLinkage)
data(RLdata500)
head(RLdata500)
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Total number of all to all record comparisons
choose(500,2)
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Block by last name initial  
last_init <- substr(RLdata500[,"lname_c1"], 1, 1)
head(last_init)

# Total number of blocks
length(unique(last_init))
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Total number of records per block
recordsPerBlock <- table(last_init)
head(recordsPerBlock)
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5}
# Block sizes can vary 
plot(recordsPerBlock, 
     cex.axis=0.6, xlab="", ylab="")
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Total number of records pairs per block
sapply(recordsPerBlock, choose, k=2)

# Reduction on comparison space
sum(sapply(recordsPerBlock, choose, k=2))
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

What is the overall dimension reduction form the original space to the reduced space induced by blocking? 

Recall the original space of comparisons was 
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
choose(500,2)
```

We have reduced the number of comparisons to 
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sum(sapply(recordsPerBlock, choose, k=2))
```

# How do we calculate the reducation ratio?

```{r}
#reduction.ratio <- function(block.labels) 1 - sum(choose(table(block.labels),2)) / choose(length(block.labels),2)
```

# How do we calculate the reducation ratio?

```{r}
#rr <- reduction.ratio()
```

# Pairwise Evaluation Metrics

Calculate the Pairwise Precision and Recall. 
\textcolor{red}{Need a function that works for this generally.}

# Case Study to El Salvador 

We return to the case study on El Salvador, where we will investigate deterministic blocking as done in Sadinle (2014). 

# Task 1

Implement the blocking procedure from Sadinle (2014), where the blocking criterion is XXX. 

# Task 2

Explain why you think the author choose this blocking criterion. 

# Task 3

What is the reduction ratio, precision, and recall assuming that the ground truth is true in this situation? 

# Task 4

Can you come up with a better blocking criterion for this data set that is deterministic?
