# What is "Bayesian"?

1. Setting up a *full probability model* -- a joint probability distribution for all observable and unobservable quantities
    \begin{align*}
    p(\boldsymbol x | \boldsymbol \theta) &- \text{ likelihood} \\
    p(\boldsymbol \theta) &- \text{ prior}
    \end{align*}
2. Conditioning on observed data -- calculating and interpreting the appropriate *posterior distribution*
    $$
    p(\boldsymbol \theta | \boldsymbol x) = \frac{p(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol \theta)}{p(\boldsymbol x)} = \frac{p(\boldsymbol x|\boldsymbol \theta)p(\boldsymbol \theta)}{p(\boldsymbol x)} \propto p(\boldsymbol x|\boldsymbol \theta)p(\boldsymbol \theta)
    $$
    
    
# Why Bayesian Entity Resolution


1. Entity resolution can be treated as a clustering problem. 
2. Records are clustering to a latent entity.
3. This results in the model becoming a bipartite graph, which allows one to 
estimate latent individuals across multiple high dimensional databases.
4. The Bayesian paradigm naturally allows uncertainty quantification of the entity resolution process, a full posterior distribution, credible intervals, etc. 
5. Theoretical properties have recently been explored for latent variable models, supporting the above approach.

# Notation

- $X_{ij\ell}$: observed value of the $\ell$th field for the $j$th record in the $i$th data set, $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $1 \leq j \leq n_i$. 

\vspace{1mm}

- $Y_{j'\ell}$: true value of the $\ell$th field for the j'th latent individual. 

\vspace{1mm}

- $\lambda_{ij}$: latent individual to which the $j$th record in the $i$th list corresponds. $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is the collection of these values.. 
    * e.g. Five records in one list $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3\}
    \rightarrow$ 3 latent entities or clusters.

\vspace{1mm}

- $z_{ij\ell}$: indicator of whether a distortion has occurred for record field value $X_{ij\ell}$
