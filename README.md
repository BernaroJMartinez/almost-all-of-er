[Syllabus]()

The syllabus is a comprehensive place regarding expectations for the course.

[Piazza]()

Piazza will be used as a group forum for all questions for the course as well as announcements. 

[Github]()

Github will be used for all homework submissions and group projects. You will be expected to have group repository for this class that is organized by your group leader. [[OB: We should perhaps make a template for this and have students fork this to make workflow easier?]

# Required Readings

Required readings for the course will be posted on the course webpage. 

## Required Material

Before starting the course for the fall semester, I would highly recommend review the pre-req material for the course on the syllabus. Given the shortened semester, please make sure that you are 100 percent comfortable with the pre-req material before taking STA 490/690. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to me as soon as possible. Specifically, please be sure to review STA 360/602 if you feel rusty with any components from this course. If you have not learned maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), I would ask that you learn this before the first day of class. 

## Introduction/Review to R

R programming will be fundamental to this course, please be sure to refresh this if you're not comfortable with R.

## Tenative Course Schedule 

1. Module 1: Intro to ER and foundational ER applications. Motivating applications in the class:

- NLTCS 
- Voter registration (ones from the Marchant paper)

- El Salvdor data set (SV) 

Reading: Christen (2012), Binette and Steorts (2020).

2. Module 2: Collobration and Effecitive Workflow

Reading: XXX

3. Module 3: Pipeline approaches, String distance functions, and the Fellegi-Sunter method with an application to SV. 

Reading Christen (2012), give page numbers. Binette and Steorts (2020), give page numbers, Fellegi and Sunter (1969), Newcombe et al. (1959). 

4. Module 4: Blocking with an application to SV. 

Steorts et al. (2014), Murray (2016), Sadosky et al. (2015). 

5. Module 5: Blocking, FS, and fastLink with an application to SV. 

Steorts et al. (2014), Murray (2016), Sadosky et al. (2015), Edmorando et al. (2019). 

6. Module 6: Locality sensitive hashing with an application to SV (??).

Mining Massive Datasets, Chapter 3. 

7. Module 7: Logistic Regression/Random Forests with an Application to Patent Data or Forensic Science Data (??).

Papers. 

8. Module 8: Bayesian FS with an Application to SV. 

Fortini et al. (2001), Sadinle (2014), Sadile (2017). 

9. Module 9: Bayesian Graphical ER with an Application to NLTCS/Voter Registration Files.

Steorts et al. (2014, 2016), Steorts (2015), Marchant et al. (2020). 

10. Module 10: fastlink-dblink with an application to RLdata10000/NLTCS. 
(This code needs to be re-worked to apply it to larger data sets and this could be a group project). This would be a solely coding based project and students would need to have a CS background to do this. The issue here is the shared MPMMS. (I didn't have time to fix this, and it might be quick or it might not be). 

Edmorando and Steorts (2020). 

## Format of Lecture

75 minute lecture

- 25 minutes: lecture on general topic
- 25 minutes: break out sections for coding on topic/exploration of students in groups regarding data set and proposed tasks. Working toward a homework assignment on the topic. 
- 20 minutes: discussion/question session on papers, general topic, and coding
- 5 minutes: summary regarding what was learned by students and what is still unclear about the method that they will work on in 1-1 meeting with their group (and if needed via feedback from TA team during OH during the week).
